# Starlite
6 and 8-point stars using an FPGA to produce numerous patterns via a simple instruction set.
One doesn't need to know anything about FPGAs to create your own custom displays.
Refer to the "Documents" directory for project documents.
The Eagle directory has the schematic and the board design files.
The Mechanical directory has the 2D CAD files for laser cutting acrylic into star shapes and the 3D CAD files for the optional back covers.
The SolUP12 directory has all the FPGA files for the no longer recommended Lattice iCEcube2 build enviorment.
The SolRadi directory has all the FPGA files for the recommended Lattice Radiant build enviorment.
